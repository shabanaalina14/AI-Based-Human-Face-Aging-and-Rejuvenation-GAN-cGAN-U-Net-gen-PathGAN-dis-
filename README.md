AI-Based Human Face Aging and Rejuvenation
GAN (cGAN) • U-Net Generator • PatchGAN Discriminator

This repository implements an AI-based system for face aging and face rejuvenation using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework. The model takes a face image and a target age group as input and outputs an age-progressed or age-regressed (younger/older) version of the same identity.

🚀 Features

Age progression & regression using a single unified model

U-Net-based Generator for high-resolution image translation

PatchGAN Discriminator for enhanced local texture realism

Conditional GAN (cGAN) for controlling age transformation

Identity preservation through perceptual loss (optional)

Support for custom datasets

CPU & GPU compatible
